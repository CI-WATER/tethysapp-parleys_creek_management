      <!-- Description of tool -->
      <p>
      	The Parleys Watershed is one of four drainages that are included in Salt Lake City's
      	"Protected Watershed" Canyons. Parley's Creek Basin, located on western slope of Wasatch
      	Mountains, includes two reservoirs, Little Dell and Mountain Dell. The reservoirs were
      	developed with the primary use of municipal and industrial water supply and secondary use
      	of flood control. The primary inflows are generated from Lamb's and Dell Creek.
     </p>
     <p>
     	This application can be used to evaluate various management scenarios for the Parley's Creek
     	system to give this ability to managers, stakeholders, and users to test different alternatives.
     	This also can be used to test climate change scenarios (uncertain future extreme climate
     	conditions) to evaluate the reservoirs' performance. Click on the "New Scenario" button to
     	get started.
